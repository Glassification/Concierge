There are no houses on the ground and people must move from tree to tree, some trees are magic.  There is a herb shop called the Spider's Grove on east side of town.

Because the group is now in MBRGA (Make Blinding Rock Great Again) Country, Caleston could no longer be the face of the group and was forced to watch as Gray took up the mantle. The group found the entrance to the mine, acquired passes, and started the long trek down in search of their quarry. Caleston forgot to ask where giant snails could be found so he picked a direction and started walking. After several hours Gray got fed up and demanded they turn around and ask directions, but before they could a unicorn appeared and then disappeared just as quickly. The group made it back to the 'surface' and Gray convinced a local named Zandos to be our guide, to his later regret after Grey started to put the fear of God into him. During this whole endeavor Caleston was also suffering from severe exhaustion from his demon problems, and so was moving at a reduced speed.}\\li0\\ri0\\sa0\\sb0\\fi0\\ql\\par}\r\n{\\f3 \\li0\\ri0\\sa0\\sb0\\fi0\\ql\\par}\r\n{\\f3 {\\ltrch After a few hours journey in the RIGHT direction, we stumbled across two Dark Elves and their three slaves. While most of the group didn't want to get involved, Lafawnda demanded we do the right thing. But it was Gilbert's purchase of the female slaves that sparked Caleston's decision to go back and kill the slavers while the rest of the group argued (and also to get the money Gilbert payed). He made short work of the first elf, but the other one caused him a little bit of difficulty and he was forced to call for help. After a short battle the last elf made a run for it, but we were just barely able to kill him and free the slaves. Caleston took most of the gold as a finder's fee, and Gilbert was none too happy about losing his groupies. }\\li0\\ri0\\sa0\\sb0\\fi0\\ql\\par}\r\n{\\f3 \\li0\\ri0\\sa0\\sb0\\fi0\\ql\\par}\r\n{\\f3 {\\ltrch We set off once again, deeper and deeper into the earth. Magical spells seemed to be malfunctioning in these tunnels, but Gray was adamant his spell casting was in no way related to the odd occurrences. Even after he turned himself into a potted plant several times. Meanwhile, Zandos was getting increasingly panicked because the snails were nowhere to be found and Gray's threats were becoming more creative. Just when all seemed lost for Zandos, a giant snail appeared out of the darkness. The great beast loomed in front of the adventures, fangs glistening, eye stalks menacing, ready to give our hero's a real challenge. Caleston then killed it with two shots, before it could even react. All seemed well until Gray cast a spell and caused crazed unicorn to appear and start attacking the group. It was a tough fight, but things were looking good until Gray in his infinite stupidity cast another spell and spawned a yet another unicorn. After several close calls, the unicorns were banished and the party was victorious. Caleston collected the shell and the party began the long trip back to the 'surface' with Gray now acutely aware of the consequences of casting spells this far down.}\\li0\\ri0\\sa0\\sb0\\fi0\\ql\\par}\r\n}\r\n}",

He realized the magnitue of his his mistake as soon as the words were out of his mouth, but it was too late. He was healed, but Lafonda, Caleston and Gilbert were covered heat to toe in grease. While Gilbert began cleaning up his mess, Gray got impacient and figured he was powerfull enough to travers the narrow path without Calestons perceptive eyes. This nearly proved to be his undoing, when he lost his footing and began to falled into the monster infested waters below. He would have been lost forever if not for the quick thinking of Kussandrick, and his unequaled strength; hauling up Gray's useless body without breaking a sweat.

You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level.
