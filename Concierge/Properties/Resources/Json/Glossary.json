The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n## %{color:steelblue}Athletics%\r\n\r\nYour Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:\r\n\r\n* You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.\r\n* You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.\r\n* You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\r\n\r\n## %{color:steelblue}Other Strength Checks%\r\n\r\nThe DM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\r\n\r\n* Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door\r\n* Break free of bonds\r\n* Push through a tunnel that is too small\r\n* Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it\r\n* Tip over a statue\r\n* Keep a boulder from rolling\r\n\r\n## %{color:steelblue}Attack Rolls and Damage%\r\n\r\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n## %{color:steelblue}Lifting and Carrying%\r\n\r\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\r\n\r\n__Carrying Capacity__. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.\r\n\r\n__Push, Drag, or Lift__. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\r\n\r\n__Size and Strength__. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\r\n\r\n\r\n## %{color:steelblue}Variant: Encumbrance%\r\n\r\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment.\r\n\r\nIf you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.\r\n\r\nIf you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\r\n",

Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.\r\n\r\nYou can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.\r\n\r\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.\r\n\r\n__Passive Perception.__ When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\r\n\r\n__What Can You See?__ One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured as explained in chapter 8, “Adventuring.”",

For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2.
